# Testing Statistical Graphics

## Introduction

- Overview of contributory disciplines
    - psychophysics 
    - mathematical psychology 
        - [@fernandez_is_2009; @sun_framework_2012; @varshney_why_2013; @dehaene_neural_2003]
    - cognitive psychology 
    - human/computer interaction 
- Different approaches to graphics
    - Tufte/chartjunk
    - Experimentally validated recommendations
    - Aesthetics
- Grammar of graphics
    - data mappings
    - separate physical representation from the underlying data - makes testing much easier

## Testing Methods

- Psychophysics - method of adjustment/limits
- Standard psychology paradigms
    - Cleveland & McGill style straight estimation
        - heavily depends on the exact questions asked
    - Think-aloud (more qualitative)
    - Eye Tracking
    - Preattentive judgements a la Healey
        - don't obviously translate to how graphics are actually used
- Visual Inference [@buja_statistical_2009; @wickham_graphical_2010; @hofmann_graphical_2012; @chowdhury_wheres_2012; @zhao_mind_2013; @majumder_validation_2013]
    - removes the exact question problem (mostly)
    - visual system conducts a ton of tests simultaneously
    - powerful when combined with grammar of graphics
    - can test salience of data features with two-target design [@vanderplas_clusters_2017]

## Actual conclusions about best graphical practice

Potential Topics

- Bar Charts
- Shading
- Maps - chloropleth, hex, etc.?
- Polar coordinate systems are (mostly) bad
- Double encoding vs. chartjunk
- 

## Current open questions
