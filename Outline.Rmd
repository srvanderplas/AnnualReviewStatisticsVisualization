# Testing Statistical Graphics

## Introduction

- Overview of contributory disciplines
    - psychophysics
    - cognitive psychology
    - human/computer interaction
- Grammar of graphics
    - data mappings
    - separate physical representation from the underlying data - makes testing much easier

## Testing Methods

- Cleveland & McGill style straight estimation
    - heavily depends on the exact questions asked
- Eye Tracking
- Preattentive judgements a la Healey
    - don't obviously translate to how graphics are actually used
- Visual Inference
    - removes the exact question problem (mostly)
    - visual system conducts a ton of tests simultaneously
    - powerful when combined with grammar of graphics
    - can test salience of data features with two-target design

## Actual conclusions about best graphical practice

- Polar coordinate systems are (mostly) bad
-
