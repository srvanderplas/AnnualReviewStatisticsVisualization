The National Research Council of the National Academies and the legal and forensic sciences communities have called for research to measure the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners decisions, a challenging and complex problem in need of systematic analysis. Our research is focused on the development of empirical approaches to studying this problem. Here, we report on the first large-scale study of the accuracy and reliability of latent print examiners decisions, in which 169 latent print examiners each compared approximately 100 pairs of latent and exemplar fingerprints from a pool of 744 pairs. The fingerprints were selected to include a range of attributes and quality encountered in forensic casework, and to be comparable to searches of an automated fingerprint identification system containing more than 58 million subjects. This study evaluated examiners on key decision points in the fingerprint examination process; procedures used operationally include additional safeguards designed to minimize errors. Five examiners made false positive errors for an overall false positive rate of 0.1\%. Eighty-five percent of examiners made at least one false negative error for an overall false negative rate of 7.5\%. Independent examination of the same comparisons by different participants (analogous to blind verification) was found to detect all false positive errors and the majority of false negative errors in this study. Examiners frequently differed on whether fingerprints were suitable for reaching a conclusion.},

The experiment consists of an online video-game (http://arora.ccs.neu.edu) where players are challenged to distinguish actual ﬁnancial market returns from random temporal permutations of those returns. We ﬁnd overwhelming statistical evidence (p-values no greater than 0.5\%) that subjects can consistently distinguish between the two types of time series, thereby refuting the widespread belief that ﬁnancial markets “look random”. A key feature of the experiment is that subjects are given immediate feedback regarding the validity of their choices, allowing them to learn and adapt. We suggest that such novel interfaces can harness human capabilities to process and extract information from ﬁnancial data in ways that computers cannot.},

	abstract = {Statistical graphics play an important role in exploratory data analysis, model checking and diagnosis. With high dimensional data, this often means plotting low-dimensional projections, for example, in classification tasks projection pursuit is used to find low-dimensional projections that reveal differences between labelled groups. In many contemporary data sets the number of observations is relatively small compared to the number of variables, which is known as a high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) problem. This paper explores the use of visual inference on understanding low-dimensional pictures of HDLSS data. Visual inference helps to quantify the significance of findings made from graphics. This approach may be helpful to broaden the understanding of issues related to HDLSS data in the data analysis community. Methods are illustrated using data from a published paper, which erroneously found real separation in microarray data, and with a simulation study conducted using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.},

	abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

In this work, we explore user performance for comparison, slope, and discrimination tasks for different line graph techniques involving multiple time series. Our results show that techniques that create separate charts for each time series–such as small multiples and horizon graphs–are generally more efficient for comparisons across time series with a large visual span. On the other hand, shared-space techniques–like standard line graphs–are typically more efficient for comparisons over smaller visual spans where the impact of overlap and clutter is reduced.},

With output devices such as computer displays providing a large number of colors, developers sometimes tend to build their visualization to be visually appealing, while forgetting the main goal of clear depiction of the underlying data. Visualization researchers have profited from findings in adjoining areas such as human vision and psychophysics which, combined with their own experience, enabled them to establish guidelines that might help practitioners to select appropriate color scales and adjust the associated color maps, for particular applications. This survey presents an overview on the subject of color scales by focusing on important guidelines, experimental research work and tools proposed to help non-expert users.},

	abstract = {The representation of a parameter in a two-dimensional image using color is discussed. Desirable properties of color scales are stated. The notion of an optimal color scale is introduced and the development of a particular optimal color scale is described; restrictions on the order of colors in an optimal color scale are stated and an algorithm is presented to search for scales that obey those constraints. The linearization of color scales is discussed. The result of such two-step process is presented in the form of the Linearized Optimal Color Scale (LOCS). Observer performance experiments were conducted to study the merits of color scales for medical image data. The results of the study show that although observers performed somewhat better with the newly developed LOCS than with the previously advocated heated-object color scale, they performed signi cantly better with a linearized gray scale than with either of the color scales. Possible resons for this result are discussed.},

The proposed framework allows the author to annotate his/her intended color eﬀects to the colored document. They are used to generate a repainted document that let the colorblind enjoy similar color eﬀects that normal color vision person does for the original document. The annotations are formulated as a set of mathematical constraints that can describe several commonly used color eﬀects. Constraints are deﬁned over the normal vision color space. Then they are projected onto the restricted color space that corresponds to the one that the colorblind perceives. Finally, the projected constraints are resolved for the search of best repainting of the document that most successfully presents to the colorblind person the color eﬀects experienced by the normal vision person on the original document. Eﬀectiveness of the proposal is shown by colorblind simulation.},

	abstract = {Although at any instant we experience a rich, detailed visual world, we do not use such visual details to form a stable representation across views. Over the past five years, researchers have focused increasingly on ‘change blindness’ (the inability to detect changes to an object or scene) as a means to examine the nature of our representations. Experiments using a diverse range of methods and displays have produced strikingly similar results: unless a change to a visual scene produces a localizable change or transient at a specific position on the retina, generally, people will not detect it. We review theory and research motivating work on change blindness and discuss recent evidence that people are blind to changes occurring in photographs, in motion pictures and even in real-world interactions. These findings suggest that relatively little visual information is preserved from one view to the next, and question a fundamental assumption that has underlain perception research for centuries: namely, that we need to store a detailed visual representation in the mind/brain from one view to the next.},
