	title = {Visions of maps and graphs},
	abstract = {Cartography and statistics have much in common and many bonds beyond the presence of a statistician as speaker at your excellent banquet. In general terms, cartography and statistics both deal with the compression or distillation of com plex quantitative data sets into packages comprehensible to human eyes and minds. Another general similarity is that both statistics and cartography are much con cerned with the efficient design of investigations. The two disciplines have long historical links. Let me read you a short quotation from G. N. dark's 194 \& book, Science and Social Welfare in the Age of Newton. Under discussion are the advances in cartography in England during the late sixteenth century; Professor Clark says that "This new cartography was used in the service of the state, for instance by the great Cecil in Elizabethan England, who employed more than one map-maker. In all its aspects it was closely allied to statistics. The estate maps often had in the corners tables of the amounts of land held by different owners, or the numbers of beasts they had a right to pasture. The county maps of Saxton, the most notable of Cecil's cartographers, were accompanied by des criptions which gave figures. This was no accident but arose from the nature of the two methods. A map is an abstract statement based on measurement; statistics are abstract statements based on measurement, counting, and calculation. If this appears to be a farfetched identifi cation, let it be remembered that two of the pioneers of statistical science, Petty and Gregory King, were surveyors before they were statisticians. Neither of them... got very far away from the geographical point of view."},

Today, statistical graphics appear to be reemerging as an important analytic tool, with recent innovations exploiting computer graphics and related technologies.]},
