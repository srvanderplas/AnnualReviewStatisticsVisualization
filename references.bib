It examines the lineup protocol described in Buja et al. [2009] developing numerical statistics to measure the quality of the lineup. Distance measures are developed that describe how close the observed data plot is to the null plots, and how close the null plots are to each other. These measures are compared with choices made by human judges, to decide on the best distance measures to use for particular plot types.},

	abstract = {Two tasks, varying in their demands to integrate multiple information sources, were used in a comparison of two graphical display formats. One display technique, an ‘object display’, utilized different dimensions of a single perceptual object to display task-relevant information. A contrasting graphical technique, a ‘bar graph’, used the same dimension of several separate objects to present identical information. In one experiment, 24 subjects used both displays to perform a simulated process control task in which integration of information from several time-varying sources was required. In a second experiment, 20 additional subjects used both displays in a non-integration task that required monitoring for particular values of six independent system outputs. Results of the integration experiment revealed that performance was superior when the object display was used. However, when the non-integration task was studied, the bar graphs provided more efficient performance. Thus, the requirement to integrate information from several sources may prove to be a predictor of when object displays may be most effectively used.},

An equivalent and complementary view of kernels as a measure of similarity highlights their effectiveness in low-dimensional and low-complexity learning and generalization — tasks that are indispensable in cognitive information processing. In this survey, we seek (i) to highlight some parallels between kernels in machine learning on the one hand and similarity in psychology and neuroscience on the other hand, (ii) to sketch out new research directions arising from these parallels, and (iii) to clarify some aspects of the way kernels are presented and discussed in the literature that may have affected their perceived relevance to cognition. In particular, we aim to resolve the tension between the view of kernels as a method of raising the dimensionality, and the various requirements of reducing dimensionality for cognitive purposes. We identify four fundamental constraints that apply to any cognitive system that is charged with learning from the statistics of its world, and argue that kernel-like neural computation is particularly suited to serving such learning and decision making needs, while simultaneously satisfying these constraints.},

If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens’ law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.},

	abstract = {Starting with a computational analysis of brightness matching, we develop a novel variational framework able to model perceptual context-driven effects that may be extended to non-physical judgments as well. The most important feature of the variational framework is the description of these phenomena as a suitable balance between contrast and dispersion. The optimal balance is defined through the simultaneous minimization of functionals characterized by two terms in opposition to each other. When the minimum is reached, the equilibrium between contrast and dispersion is attained. To show the flexibility of the proposed framework, we discuss several examples of such functionals in the field of color perception and cognition which show adherence between theoretical predictions and empirical results. With regard to social cognition theories, the simultaneous occurrence of contrast and dispersion conflicts with sequential models, thus supporting the idea of a concurrent presence of both effects in each judgment. The variational framework can serve as a view from above on perceptual and cognitive phenomena that may help in deriving new constraints for disambiguating alternative theories.},

An even stronger connection is drawn between the Weber–Fechner law and a Bayesian framework when neural storage or communication is the dominant concern, such as for numerosity. Theoretical results and experimental verification for perception of sound intensity are both presented.},

	abstract = {This meta-analysis integrates 296 effect sizes reported in eye-tracking research on expertise differences in the comprehension of visualizations. Three theories were evaluated: Ericsson and Kintsch’s (Psychol Rev 102:211–245, 1995) theory of long-term working memory, Haider and Frensch’s (J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cognit 25:172–190, 1999) information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception of Kundel et al. (Radiology 242:396–402, 2007). Eye movement and performance data were cumulated from 819 experts, 187 intermediates, and 893 novices. In support of the evaluated theories, experts, when compared with non-experts, had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task-relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas; experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant information, owing to superiority in parafoveal processing and selective attention allocation. Eye movements, reaction time, and performance accuracy were moderated by characteristics of visualization (dynamics, realism, dimensionality, modality, and text annotation), task (complexity, time-on-task, and task control), and domain (sports, medicine, transportation, other). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of visual expertise in professional domains and their significance for the design of learning environments.},

	abstract = {Retrospective Think aloud (RTA) is a usability method that collects the verbalization of a user’s performance after the performance is over. There has been little work done to investigate the validity and reliability of RTA. This paper reports on an experiment investigating these issues using the method called stimulated RTA. By comparing subjects’ verbalizations with their eye movements, we found stimulated RTA to be valid and reliable: the method provides a valid account of what people attended to in completing tasks, it has a low risk of introducing fabrications, and its validity is unaffected by task complexity. More detailed analysis of RTA shows that it also provides additional information about user’s inferences and strategies in completing tasks. The findings of this study provide valuable support for usability practitioners to use RTA and to trust the users’ performance information collected by this method in a usability study.},
